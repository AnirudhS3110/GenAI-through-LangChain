# Prompts:
- THese are inout instructions or Queries given to a model to guide to its output
## Two types of PRompts:
- Static
- Dynamic

### Static:
- Static Prompts are we feed into LLM without modifying teh USer's input.
- Not used much, as we are giving the User More control in Our Application in terms of Prompting, this is because LLM's output is directly dependent upon the Given input to it.
- If a user gives a wrong topic name. The LLM will give output for teh wrong topic, which could lead to Hallucination
- We need to provide a Consistent User Experience to the User from using our LLM app, static prompting doesnt help it

### Dynamic Orompts:
- These are Templased based or Structured Prompts.
